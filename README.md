# Webpack
Task within Kodilla bootcamp. The aim was to use Webpack in my projects for the first time.
There were 2 Tasks - a new branch on each was created.

Branch Task1 - installing and configuration of Webpack.

Branch Task2 - creating a simple app 'to do list' using Webpack and React (loaders, plugins, Hot Module Replacement).
